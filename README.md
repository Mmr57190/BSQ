You must find the largest possible square.
The file is valid if it is respecting those constraints:

  - its first line contains the number of lines on the board (and only that),
  - “.” (representing an empty place) and “o” (representing an obstacle) are the only two characters for the other lines,
  - all of the lines are of the same length (except the first one),
  - it contains at least one line
  - each line is terminated by ‘\n’.
  - My project passes 70% of the tests, moreover it is presented with tests in bash.

  
You program must print the board, with some “.” replaced by “x” to represent the largest square you found.
